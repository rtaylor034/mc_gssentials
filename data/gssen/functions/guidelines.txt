should be loaded BEFORE any pack that depends on it


a pack should have 3 top-level function folders:
- api
    - only methods that are exposed publicly.
    - usually (but not always) has inputs and outputs.
    - see below section about API standards/structure
- impl
    - strictly for functions that aid in the implementation of 'api' methods.
- internal
    - contains all non-api-implementation private functions.
    - other than the required 'tick' and 'load' functions, structure is entirely defined by developer.

# API structure


# API FUNCTION GUIDELINES
positive values SHOULD reflect some sort of success.
0 or negative values MUST reflect some sort of failure.
a function is RECOMMENDED to to express failure as non-zero negative return values OR exclusively returning 0.
