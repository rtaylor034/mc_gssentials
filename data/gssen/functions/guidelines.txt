should be loaded BEFORE any pack that depends on it


a pack should have 2-3 top-level function folders:
- 'api'
    - only methods that are exposed publicly.
    - usually (but not always) has inputs and outputs.
    - see below section about API standards/structure
- '_'
    - contains all private functions.
    - other than 'load', structure is entirely defined by developer.
- 'debug' (optional)
    - public methods intended for debugging or administration purposes.
    - methods in debug should only be ran manually in-game.

function tags should have the structure specified below:
'pack/tags/functions'
 - 'events/'
    - the function tag equivalent of 'api'. should follow gvent standards.
 - '_/'
    - contains all private function tags.
 - 'pre_load' || 'load' || post_load'
    - these tags are special top level tags that are to be included in their respective lantern load functions.
    - they exist for easy recognition and specification from other packs that may need to load the pack as a dependency.
        - the pack can just include '#<pack>:load' in '#load:load' without having to worry about finding the load function.
    - a pack is to ONLY include the load tag it needs,
        example: gssen only has '#gssen:pre_load', not '#gssen:load' or '#gssen:post_load'.

# Other Resources
for all other resources that the pack provides (loot tables, tags, predicates, etc.) the top-level directory is to be used as the public directory with the exception of '_/' being the private subdirectory.

# API structure


# API FUNCTION GUIDELINES
positive values SHOULD reflect some sort of success.
0 or negative values MUST reflect some sort of failure.
a function is RECOMMENDED to to express failure as non-zero negative return values OR exclusively returning 0.
